# Drowsiness detection using yolov5 and rcnn
In this project, we developed a drowsiness detection model using both YOLOv5 and RCNN to detect key facial features related to drowsiness, such as eye closure and yawning. YOLOv5 provided faster real-time detection due to its efficient architecture, while RCNN, though slower, offered higher accuracy in detecting subtle facial expressions. We compared the performance of both models in terms of detection speed and accuracy, with YOLOv5 being more suitable for real-time applications and RCNN excelling in precision under controlled environments.
